<p>Alia Atreides (November[2] 10191 AG - 10219 AG), also known as Saint Alia of the Knife and later Coan-Tean ("the female death-spirit who walks without feet") to the Fremen and called Hawt the Fish Monster on the outer worlds, was the posthumous daughter of Duke Leto Atreides I and his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica. Born on Arrakis, she was the younger sister of Paul Atreides.</p>
<p>As Regent of the Atreides Empire, she established an autocratic government based on her cult of personality. Succumbing to ancestral possession, she later leapt to her death in defiance of the genetic memory of her maternal grandfather, Vladimir Harkonnen.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>A young woman of extraordinary cognitive powers, Alia was born several months after her father was murdered by her maternal grandfather and her mother and brother were forced to flee in exile into the deep desert. Her ancestral memories awakened in the womb when Jessica underwent the Water of Life ritual to become the Reverend Mother of Stilgar's Fremen tribe. Thus she was preborn, and therefore highly susceptible to ancestral influence.</p>
<p>After her brother's two-year rise as the Fremen messiah brought Emperor Shaddam and Baron Harkonnen to Arrakis to intervene in the Desert War, Alia allowed herself to be captured during a Sardaukar raid and took this chance to avenge her father by fatally pricking the Baron with a gom jabbar as she informed him of their familial ties.</p>
<p>As Paul-Muad'Dib's army and sandworms conquered the combined forces of the Imperial Sardaukar and House Harkonnen Military, little Alia slew dying soldiers on the battlefield for their water, earning her the title St. Alia of the Knife.</p>
<h2>Paul's reign</h2>
<p>Twelve years into Emperor Muad'Dib's bloody rule, Alia regularly sermonized a community of fearful distrust despite their devout worship of her "holy" family.</p>
<p>Distressed by the weakening state of her prescient powers amidst widespread use of the Dune Tarot, she subjected herself to a near-fatal overdose of spice melange and brought herself ever closer toward Abomination.</p>
<h2>Regency</h2>
<h2>Early rule</h2>
<p>After Paul's stone burner-induced blindness forced his exile into the deep desert following the birth of his preborn twins - Leto II and Ghanima - Alia was left as Regent of the Atreides Empire.</p>
<p>Grief-stricken by her brother's loss and desperate to keep his Empire intact, she was soon corrupted by power and established a theocratic cult of personality, using rich trappings and grandiose titles such as the Mahdinate to amplify her political standing and religious mystique.</p>
<h2>Decline</h2>
<p>Years later, the love Alia had for her family became twisted as the countless ancestors in her mind tormented her for dominance - the loudest and most powerful being her dead Harkonnen grandfather, who offered to silence these other voices in exchange for her cooperation in granting him fleeting moments of possession and renewed life. These pleasures included both sex and food, with the Baron's signature overindulgence resulting in a "plumpness which had begun to bulge her body."</p>
<p>Little by little the Baron warped Alia's fragile mind into plotting against the people she loved most, including her mother, niece and nephew. By the time Leto II returned from the desert and confronted her at her Imperial Keep, she was in the full throes of Abomination and nothing more than a puppet for Vladimir Harkonnen. However, Alia was no match for her sandtrout-enhanced nephew and, in a brief moment of clarity, threw herself out a high window to end her grandfather's torment - a sacrifice witnessed by all of her surviving family.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Alia's first words to her Fremen nurse were "I love you, Harah." While her childhood relationship with Harah was warm, her unique abilities and precocious maturity made her an object of fear and superstition in her sietch. Because of the conscious and overwhelming trauma she experienced in the womb, Alia's relationship with her mother was strained at best and simmered with deep resentment. As an adult, she found "nothing strange in loving and hating her mother simultaneously.”</p>
<p>While it's fair to say that Alia understood her preborn niece and nephew better than most, their relationship was challenging. While recognizing that they, like her, were never really children, she was frustrated over their refusal to experiment with the spice. They, in turn, could only pity her as they understood the psychological and social strain that plagued her entire existence.</p>
<p>Though she loved and admired her brother, she also suffered the burden of being the sister of an emperor and living god. And while her love for Duncan Idaho may have been genuine, her gradual descent into Abomination - including her infidelity with Javid and other men - slowly destroyed this relationship.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Alia's religious influence was long-lived. Revered in life, she was still worshiped 35 centuries after her death. Toward the end of her nephew's long life, a Cult of Alia was discovered on Giedi Prime by Duncan Idaho's agents. Ultimately, however, Alia's influence vanished soon after the God Emperor's demise.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The name Alia (also spelt Alya or Aaliyah) means "sky, heaven, loftiness" in Arabic and "other, another, else" in Latin.</p>
<h2>Portrayals</h2>
<p>In the 1984 film, Alicia Witt portrayed the character wearing a hijab, a headscarf commonly worn by Arab and Muslim women.</p>
<p>While still responsible for the Baron's demise in the 1984 film, her method of killing him is dramatically protracted by slashing his face with her gom jabbar, pulling out his implanted suspensor cables and using telekinesis to spin him in the air, through a shattered ceiling and into the open maw of her brother's sandworm.</p>
<p>Laura Burton portrayed Alia as a child in the 2000 miniseries, while Daniela Amavia took over the role to play a teenager and adult in the 2003 miniseries. Interestingly, despite the character being fifteen years younger than Paul Atreides, Amavia is actually nine years older than Alec Newman.</p>
<p>Alia's weight gain is omitted from the Children of Dune miniseries, presumably to avoid the need for fatsuits and the narrative association of female obesity with evil and mental illness.</p>
<p>Alia's death is also handled differently: instead of committing suicide by autodefenestration, she stabs herself with her own crysknife to prevent the Baron from harming Leto.</p>
<p>In Dune: Part Two, the book's two-year timeskip is removed and Alia remains unborn throughout the film - though still capable of communication. However, an adult Alia, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, briefly appears to Paul in a future vision after he drinks the Water of Life.</p>
