<p>The Atreides Empire, also known as the Atreides Imperium, Muad'Dib's Empire, the Second Empire, the Holy Imperium, or the Old Empire or Old Imperium after the death of Leto II, was a colossal theocratic, multi-galactic empire established following Paul Atreides' Fremen uprising on Arrakis against the Corrino Empire, which initially saw the carrying out of Muad'Dib's Jihad but later entered three thousand years of Leto's Peace.</p>
<p>The commencement of the Atreides Empire was marked by the moving of the Imperial seat from Kaitain to Arrakeen on Arrakis. Paul, as Muad'Dib, ruled the empire for twelve years, before he transferred control to his sister, Alia Atreides as Regent. Some years after this, Paul's son Leto Atreides II ascended to the throne. Thanks to his transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid, Leto II ruled the empire for some 3,500 years, expanding the Empire to a multi-galactic scale. Upon his death the influence and control of the Atreides Empire began to fade into the background.</p>
<p>Centuries after the death of Leto II, planetary governments existed throughout the Old Atreides Empire in a loose economic federation held together partly by CHOAM and the Bene Gesserit. Some areas were ruled by the Fish Speaker Council. 1,200 years later, the federation began to slowly fall apart, and the entire Empire with it, as the Honored Matres took over control of an increasing number of planets.</p>
