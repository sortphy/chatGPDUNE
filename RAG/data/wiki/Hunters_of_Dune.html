<p>Hunters of Dune is the first part of the seventh book of the Dune series, written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. It is the first book of the Sequels of Dune.</p>
<p>Based on notes left behind by Frank Herbert, the book was released August 22, 2006. It follows up on the themes explored in God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse Dune about the danger posed to humanity by a remote, unnamed, but ever-present "great enemy."</p>

<h2>Book jacket</h2>
<p>Frank Herbert's epic continues</p>
<p>Since 1986, millions of readers have longed to know the ending of the uncompleted story which began in Heretics of Dune and continued in Chapterhouse: Dune. Before his death, Frank Herbert wrote a detailed outline for his chronological grand finale, under the working title of Dune 7, and placed it along with additional material about Dune in a bank safe deposit box. There it remained hidden for ten years, and the great Dune chronicles remained unfinished. His son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson have now completed this epic in two volumes, finally answering the questions Dune fans have been debating for almost two decades.</p>
<p>Hunters of Dune is the first of two breathtaking journeys into the world of Dune as it remakes itself in a new form after its greatest crisis.</p>

<p>And, deep in the hold of their giant ship, the refugees carry the last surviving sandworms from devastated Arrakis, as they search the universe for a new Dune.</p>
