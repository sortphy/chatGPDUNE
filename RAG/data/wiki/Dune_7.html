<p>The Dune 7 disks, found by Brian Herbert.</p>
<p>Dune 7 was the working title for Frank Herbert's seventh Dune novel. He had hinted that he was planning to end the series; however, the work was never completed because of his untimely death in February 1986. Herbert did not often work with an outline and Kevin J. Anderson believed he used these outlines when he sold the trilogy of Heretics, Chapterhouse and Dune 7 to Berkly books. [1]</p>
<p>Herbert said the seventh book would be 'probably the last, but i'll never say never again on the Dune series'. [2]</p>
<p>Hints of the direction he would have taken with Dune 7 are in Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune; however, many unanswered questions remained. He did, however, tell author Norman Spinrad that he "planned to end the series with a novel that would transition to a fictional universe of democratic rule."[3]</p>
<p>Frank Herbert himself told in an interview</p>
<p>[4]</p>
<p>Reinforcing Spinrad's claim. Neither accounts of Frank Herbert's plan for Dune 7 align particularly closely with Hunters of Dune or Sandworms of Dune so it is likely he changed his mind later on or Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson simply did not use this material.</p>
<p>In 1997, as they were searching through Herbert's belongings, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson discovered two 1980s floppy disks, labeled "Dune 7 Notes" and "Dune 7 Outline." Brian explained in an interview[5] that these contained a three to two-and-a-half page outline of his father's thoughts on the seventh Dune novel. Brian and Kevin later completed Dune 7 as two separate novels set immediately after Chapterhouse: Dune. They were released in 2006 and 2007, titled Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune, respectively. The books received a mixed critical response.</p>
