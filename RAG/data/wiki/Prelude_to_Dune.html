<p>The Prelude to Dune trilogy is a series of prequel Dune novels co-written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. These books take place a generation before the birth of Paul Atreides, and mostly follow the life of Leto Atreides I. Many characters from the original Dune novel reappear, including Lady Jessica, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the Twisted mentat Piter de Vries, and Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV. The trilogy follows various plot threads, such as Shaddam's rise to the Imperial Throne, the ongoing feud between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen, and a Bene Tleilax conquest of the planet Ix.</p>
