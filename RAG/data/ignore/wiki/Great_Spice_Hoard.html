<p>The Great Spice Hoard was a myth brought to God Emperor Leto Atreides II by his majordomo to amuse him. According to Leto, the story said there was a hoard of the spice melange, as large as a mountain, which was concealed in the depths of a distant planet before the First Empire and the Spacing Guild. The story also said that Paul-Muad'Dib went there and lived yet beside the hoard, kept alive by it, waiting. Leto's majordomo did not understand why the story disturbed the God Emperor.</p>
