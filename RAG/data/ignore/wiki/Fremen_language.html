<p>The Fremen language was a descendant of Arabic on Earth and Chakobsa, spoken on Arrakis by the Zensunni who came to become the Fremen.</p>
<h2>Evolution</h2>
<p>This article or section refers to elements from The Dune Encyclopedia</p>
<p>Fremen derives mainly from Arabic however it has distanced much from that ancient language, and enriched with other contemporary ones, usually towards simplification. The emphatic consonants as well as pharyngeals and the glottal stop have disappeared. Same happened with vocalic length.</p>
<p>Complex mutational morphology was simplified towards a syntactically isolating language.</p>
<p>Gender distinction in adjectives and dual number were noted near the end of the Zensunni's stay on Salusa Secundus.</p>
<p>While on Rossak, one Sayyadina called Yarbuz gained access to the memories of all the Sayyadinas in her ancestry and successive Reverend Mothers repeating the experience, found how far their language strayed from its ancestral form and began to educate the people to return it to the original form. Over the next centuries, they rolled back 16000 years of language change.</p>
<p>The private language of House Corrino, standard Galach the language of Ishkal (usually theological or legal concepts) as well as the speech of the dilaubite miners of Rima contributed to the vocabulary.</p>
<p>Eventually, when the Fremen were gathered on Arrakis in 7193 AG, the climate was so ferocious that an awareness of it hovered in the background of every conversation and the language naturally mirrored this awareness and priority; the vocabulary multiplied the new distinctions that allowed for their survival, such as terms for variations of sand and wind conditions. Pardot Kynes noted that they were the first people to express climate in terms of a semi-mathematic language. He also noted that the written symbols embody external relationships.</p>
<p>During Muad'dib's reign, Fremen became the sacred language of the Imperium, used in philosophy, theology law and education.</p>
<h2>Dialects and Geography</h2>
<p>The two major dialects of Fremen were Eastern and Western.</p>
<h2>Eastern</h2>
<p>The Eastern group extended from Arrakeen (30o W) to the False Wall-West and the Habbanya Erg (150o E). It included the sietches beyond the Plastic Basin and Observatory Mountains, the Rock Outcroppings on the Funeral Plain, Sietch Tabr and Bight of the Cliff.</p>
<p>The Eastern dialect figured in the rise of the Umma Regent</p>
<p>That dialect employed the plural markers -at and -an.</p>
<h2>Western</h2>
<p>The Western group extended from the Sihaya Ridge (55o W) to the False Wall-South (150o W) and included the sietches of the Ridge, Hole-in-the-Rock, Gara Kulon, Pasty Mesa, Chin Rock.</p>
<p>It employed terms borrowed from the smugglers near the edge of the Minor Erg.</p>
<p>Its plural marker was -u and Arabic adjectives retained gender distinctions. Word initial χ was absent as well as g</p>
<h2>Phonology</h2>
<p>Fremen retained most of its phonemic inventory from Arabic. It has however lost phonemic vowel gemination [aː] [eː] [iː] [oː] [uː], pharyngeals [ħ] [ʕ], emphatic consonants [tˤ] [dˤ] [sˤ] [ðˤ] [ɫ], Glottal Stop [ʔ], and voiced post-alveolar sibilant affricate [d͡ʒ].</p>
<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Words that derive from Arabic show the triconsonantal root pattern of Semitic languages: words are composed of three radical consonants, combined with patterns of vowels to generate different but related words.</p>
<p>Plural is marked by several endings depending on the dialect:</p>
<p>-at (Eastern; from Arabic feminine plural marker)</p>
<p>-an (Eastern; probably from Tailara)</p>
<p>-u (Western; probably from the Blue Hill speech of Rima).</p>
<p>However some words retained the archaic formation of Arabic. Such exceptions include abra (tear), pl. ibar.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>Fremen is a syntactically isolating language. Word order and prepositions indicate meanings. The syntactic order is SVO: subject precedes the verb, which precedes the object of the sentence.</p>
<p>Syntax is relatively free compared to Arabic, allowing, for example, the absence of relative pronouns and expanded the construct case (idafa) to allow verbal clauses to act as the complement of the head noun.</p>
<p>Patterns of negation are expanded.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>The Fremen script during the time of Muad'dib.</p>
<p>The Fremen alphabet derives from the Arabic, and is written from right to left; some dialects, such as in the Sihaya ridge, wrote boustrophedon.</p>
<p>Unlike Arabic script, this represented full vowels (attributed to Ali ben Ohasi) and later had come to be streamlined, an alphabetic script with only one form of a letter per phoneme (attributed to planetologist Liet Kynes).</p>
<p>Many values of the letters have been reassigned, new symbols have been introduced (contrived from other letters) and even totally arbitrary assignment of the letters.</p>
<p>A sign called shadda indicated a doubled consonant.</p>
<p>The Bedwine or Nomadic Fremen, reversed the letters m and u.</p>
