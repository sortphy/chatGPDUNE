<p>Leto Atreides I (10140 A.G. - March[1] 10191 A.G.) was the 20th and penultimate Duke of House Atreides and the father of Emperor Paul Atreides. Well known for his even-handed and compassionate leadership style, Leto ruled over Caladan and later Arrakis while at war with the Baron Vladimir of House Harkonnen.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Born into House Atreides, a noble family with a long history of honor and duty, Leto inherited the dukedom upon his father's death and quickly established himself as a just and respected leader, both among his subjects and his noble peers.</p>
<p>Leto had a deep and loving relationship with Lady Jessica, a Bene Gesserit acolyte gifted to him as a consort. Although never formally married, Jessica was his sole companion and the mother of his son, Paul Atreides, who would become Leto's heir and one of the most important figures in the Imperium.</p>
<h2>Life on Caladan</h2>
<p>A direct descendant of Ancient Greek monarch King Agamemnon, Leto I was famously known as the Red Duke and affectionately called Leto the Just. Celebrated for his fair and compassionate leadership, he managed the reins of Caladan and kept his military well-trained and battle-hardened, despite the softness of their verdant home and utopian lifestyle, as they could not afford weakness with the brutal Harkonnens as enemies.</p>
<p>A model of strong but fair governance over his organized but spiritually content society, Duke Leto became a prominent player in the Landsraad, much to the Padishah Emperor's concern. The fact that Leto's military power began to rival that of the Imperial Sardaukar only strained his goodwill with the Corrino monarch.</p>
<h2>Migration to Arrakis</h2>
<p>After almost two decades of rule on Caladan with the Lady Jessica, Leto was ordered by the Emperor to take over the planetary fief of Arrakis from House Harkonnen, and thus was required to move his House from Caladan to Dune. Arrakis was a notoriously difficult planet to manage, but as the only source of the spice melange, it was also immensely important. Thus the role brought both jeopardy and the jealousy of Leto's fellow noblemen among the Great Houses. Thus, Leto leapt at the chance to increase his standing in the Landsraad, even though he knew it would also put his House in great peril. Leto committed all his resources to the venture, and it was said that to illustrate this point to his people and the people of Arrakis, that upon his arrival he planted a flag upon the battlements at Arrakeen and proclaimed: "Here I am, here I remain!"</p>
<p>Leto's resolve was strengthened by a letter the Emperor had sent him upon his arrival on Arrakis. Addressed to his "Noble Duke", the letter outlined that Leto was given House Corrino's full support to introduce and uphold the rule of the Faufreluches. This letter served to illustrate Corrino duplicity, for at the same time, Shaddam Corrino IV was plotting Leto's demise.</p>
<p>During consolidation of his rule over Arrakis, Leto made a quick and positive impact on the people of Dune. His fair-handedness, political savvy, and personal charisma saw many in Arrakeen society, from the Fremen to the aristocratic Houses Minor, become supporters. However, only a short while into Leto's rule on Dune, the Emperor gave Baron Vladimir Harkonnen approval to invade and destroy House Atreides, even going so far as to provide some of his own Sardaukar in support. The Emperor's urgency in disposing of House Atreides was amplified by the fact that he had come to know that the Duke Leto had managed to develop a small force of soldiers capable of rivaling the Emperor's Sardaukar. This had been accomplished through Leto's principal advisors and generals, namely Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, and Gurney Halleck.</p>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>During the Siege of Arrakeen, Leto was betrayed by his private Suk doctor, Wellington Yueh, and turned over to the Harkonnens. Although Yueh had given Leto the chance to kill the Baron using a poisoned tooth embedded in the Duke's mouth, the scheme failed. Consequently, Leto died during the assassination attempt, but the Baron survived, although his twisted Mentat Piter de Vries was killed by the poison.</p>
<p>Some years later, Leto's remains were recovered from a funeral pyre by his son Paul in Arrakeen. Paul laid his father's remains to rest in the Skull Tomb in the desert of Arrakis. The late Duke's legacy was felt in Paul's reign as Emperor, and also in the conception of a daughter, Alia Atreides, carried by Jessica but only discovered after Leto's death. [2]</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>In some ways, Leto lived on in his son Paul and grandson Leto II, through their possession of Other Memory. It was also partially Leto's love for Duncan Idaho that saw Leto II maintain a series of Idaho gholas throughout his reign. [3] During both Paul's and Leto II's reign, millions flocked to visit Leto I's shrine, since Atreides ancestry had taken on a religious mystique. More than this, Leto came to symbolize all that was good about the Atreides bloodline: courage, integrity, loyalty, justice, and honor. As such, had Leto survived his rule on Arrakis, he would have eventually commanded the same fanaticism with which the Fremen came to follow his son.</p>
<p>Despite buying her from the Bene Gesserit for her clerical skills, it was was only natural for Leto to fall in love with Jessica, given her training in romance and seduction. However, Jessica's genuine love for Leto was a betrayal of the Sisterhood's values, including their strict order to give Leto a daughter and not the son he desired. This unauthorized male heir disrupted the breeding program so irreversibly that "the Jessica Crime" became a lasting warning for any Sister driven to similar temptation. [4]</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Leto Atreides I was a tall man with olive skin and long black hair. He had a narrow face full of angles and planes, with a high-bridged aquiline nose that gave him the look of a hawk, and woodsmoke in his gray eyes.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p>"Our supremacy on Caladan depended on sea and air power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include air power, but it's possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of 'thopter shields. The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don't dare. Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs." - 1965 novel</p>
<p>"I'll miss the sea, but a person needs new experiences. They jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow. Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken." - 1984 film</p>
<p>"A great man doesn't seek to lead; he is called to it. But if your answer is no, you'd still be the only thing I ever needed you to be: my son." - To Paul, 2021 film</p>
<p>Leto: "Jessica. You gave me a son, and from the moment he was born I never questioned you. I trusted you completely, even when you walked in shadows. Now I'm asking you this one thing. If anything happens, will you protect our son?"</p>
<p>Jessica: "With...my life."</p>
<p>Leto: "I'm not asking his mother, I'm asking the Bene Gesserit. Will you protect Paul?"</p>
<p>Jessica: "Why are you having these thoughts? Leto, this is not you."</p>
<p>Leto: "I thought we had more time."</p>
<p>— The Duke & Lady Jessica[src]</p>
<p>“Here I am. Here I remain.” - Last words</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Alejandro Jodorowsky wanted late actor David Carradine to portray Leto Atreides in his unsuccessful attempt to produce a film adaptation of Dune. Jodorowsky became interested in Carradine for the role after watching his series Kung Fu. When they met, the director reportedly passed him a bottle of Vitamin E pills and told him to "take one every day." Carradine swallowed the pills immediately and Jodorowsky knew he was "the person [he was] searching for." Jodorowsky has stated that he also considered himself for the role, especially given that his son, Brontis, was to play the role of Paul.</p>
<p>Leto Atreides was portrayed by German actor Jürgen Prochnow in the 1984 film adaptation, the late William Hurt in the 2000 miniseries, and Oscar Isaac in the 2021 film.</p>
