    <h1>The Dune Encyclopedia</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>This article or section refers to elements from The Dune Encyclopedia</p>
<p>The Dune Encyclopedia is an expansion of the Dune universe, background and commentary in the form of a reference text compiled and edited by Dr. Willis E. McNelly in 1984. A total of 43 people contributed articles to the work.</p>
<p>The book was based on the first 4 books of the original Dune saga by Frank Herbert, namely Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, and God Emperor of Dune. At the time it was written, The Dune Encyclopedia was promoted as the "official" Dune chronology. Frank Herbert, who was a personal friend of Dr. McNelly, wrote the foreword for the Encyclopedia. Rumors existed that Herbert himself contributed to it; however, if this were true, he wrote under a pseudonym, as his name only appears on the foreword.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia also presents itself as an in-universe document. It was published in 15540 AG, and its editor was Hadi Benotto. Due to the in-universe apocryphal nature of the Encyclopedia, plus Frank Herbert holding his ' own counsel on some of the issues still to be explored', the Dune Encyclopedia contains many contradictions with the established lore, information included should not be considered factual Canon to the original universe of Dune.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia provides a timeline both based on the Dune chronology by Frank Herbert, original dates of original, never-before-revealed in-universe events, as well as real history, seen from the "Dune-ish" perspective of the Imperium; the history of Terra is seen as the history of an "Imperial Seat," started by Alexander the Great and carried over by Rome, Madrid, and London, until the "interprovincial war" of World War II, when it is transferred to Washington, D.C. for the next several centuries.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Encyclopedia was printed in the United States only once as paperback on 1 June 1984 by Berkley Books, an imprint of Putnam (the publisher of all of Frank Herbert's Dune novels). It was also released in hardcover by Putnam Adult a month later, on 13 July 1984. Another paperback edition, with a different cover picture, was printed in the United Kingdom and published by Corgi Books (a division of Transworld Publishing), also in 1984.</p>
<p>In 1999, Dr. McNelly stated that he had proposed to Frank Herbert that they collaborate on a Dune prequel novel, expanding upon the Butlerian Jihad story presented in The Dune Encyclopedia. He noted, "[Frank Herbert] and I had discussed writing it together and he agreed with my general plot outline, completed first chapter, and so on, but his untimely death prevented us from continuing." [1]</p>
<p>After Herbert died in 1986, his estate took over all licensing and copyright on both past and future Dune material and intellectual property. The Dune Encyclopedia has been out of print for over 20 years, and is highly sought-after by fans.</p>
<h2>Foreword by Frank Herbert</h2>
<p>"Here is a rich background (and foreground) for the Dune Chronicles, including scholarly bypaths and amusing sidelights. Some of the contributions are sure to arouse controversy, based as they are on questionable sources. Others round out long speculation. Specialists have had their field day here with problems geological, biological, astronomical, and mystical, with pronunciations, major biographies, histories and accounts of little-known figures. The range of topics is catholic: cf. from games for amusement to games of life and death (Cheops or Pyramid Chess to "The Assassins' Handbook").</p>
<p>"The history of the Financial Synod which spawned CHOAM gets its first airing in these pages. In fact, many secrets hidden in the Dune Chronicles are answered here. How did Irulan first gain and then arouse the displeasure of Ghanima? Who was Jehanne Butler and why does the Butlerian Jihad carry her name? What are the hidden origins of the Spacing Guild? Where did spice-trance navigational techniques develop? What was Leto II's private opinion of Holy Sister Quintinius Violet Chenoeh? Does Cheops have something in common with the three-body problem?</p>
<p>"I must confess that I found it fascinating to re-enter here some of the sources on which the Chronicles are built. As the first "Dune fan," I give this encyclopedia my delighted approval, although I hold my own counsel on some of the issues still to be explored as the Chronicles unfold."</p>

<h2>Future and Canonicity</h2>
<p>McNelly repeatedly tried to reprint The Dune Encyclopedia following Frank Herbert's death in 1986. In 2000, he explained his reasons on the Dune Usenet group:</p>
<p>I am not repeat NOT interested in any financial gain from reprinting the [Dune Encyclopedia]. I would like to see it in print again because I am proud of the work done by my many contributors to the volume as well as of the vast amount of material it adds to the Arrakeen saga.[2]</p>
<p>Despite his persistence, the Herbert estate refused to allow it. McNelly warned fans against taking matters into their own hands and releasing the Encyclopedia online for free, and hinted at his frustration in the face of HLP lawyers;</p>
<p>I cannot, ethically, legally, or morally or even practically permit anyone to use anything from the DE [Dune Encyclopedia] unless prior permission is granted by the FH [Frank Herbert] estate. And that is as likely as finding open water on Arrakis. And I strongly - VERY strongly - suggest that you do not risk the wrath of FH's attorneys in using any of this material in a way not permitted by the current copyright laws. Frankly, I know of no one in the a.f.d. [alt.fan.dune Usenet Group] group who has the money to defend him/her self against a lawsuit. I know whereof I speak. [2]</p>
<p>The reason for the estate's refusal to reprint the Encyclopedia may be that many of the ideas and information presented in The Dune Encyclopedia go directly against the later two prequel trilogies, and sequel duology written after Frank Herbert's death by Brian Herbert (Frank Herbert's son) and Kevin J. Anderson, which they state complete the original series. Brian Herbert and Anderson have also stated that when writing these books, they drew on Frank Herbert's own notes, left behind after his death. In response to questions over why the new post-Frank Herbert Dune novels conflicted with The Dune Encyclopedia, the book was declared non-canon on the official Dune website in a letter credited to McNelly, Brian Herbert, and Anderson:</p>
<p>"THE DUNE ENCYCLOPEDIA reflects an alternate "DUNE universe" which did not necessarily represent the "canon" created by Frank Herbert. Frank Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, writing with Kevin J. Anderson, IS continuing to establish the canon of the DUNE universe. This is being done with the full approval of the owner of the DUNE copyright, the Herbert Limited Partnership.</p>
<p>"While Frank Herbert himself considered THE DUNE ENCYCLOPEDIA interesting and entertaining, he did not refer to Dr. McNelly's derivative work while writing any of his DUNE novels. Likewise, in writing their DUNE novels (beginning with DUNE: HOUSE ATREIDES), Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson have exclusively used, and will continue to use, Frank Herbert's original notes as well as their own imaginations, and not THE DUNE ENCYCLOPEDIA.</p>
<p>"We hope that the millions of DUNE fans will continue to enjoy all of the works written in Frank Herbert's marvelous universe."A letter written byDr. Willis McNelly,Brian Herbert, andKevin J. Anderson [3]</p>
<p>The wording of the letter raised some eyebrows — the wording does not reference that the Encyclopedia is and always was a fallible in-universe document that openly misrepresents known history and adds historical embellishments. It was also noted as being oddly out-of-step with McNelly's previous statements, prompting speculation that he was not involved in the drafting of the letter.</p>
<p>Dr. Willis E. McNelly died on April 7, 2003. The Encyclopedia remains out of print. Despite McNelly's warnings, several fan-made, searchable PDF versions are indeed available online.</p>
<h2>Herbert's involvement</h2>
<p>Frank Herbert gave his seal of approval to the contents of the Encyclopedia, albeit with the caveat that he would 'hold his own counsel' on issues still to be explored within the novels, meaning Herbert's novels take canonical precedence. should any contradictions arise. Frank did however, use elements of the Encyclopedia within his own work. The planets Reenol and Kronin were both first mentioned in the Encyclopedia, and later mentioned in Chapterhouse: Dune. Likewise, the Encyclopedia was the first to give the name of the founder of the Mentats as Gilbertus Albans. Albans became in a major character in Mentats of Dune and Reenol was mentioned in Dune: House Corrino, despite being original creations from a property Brian Herbert and Anderson do not consider canon. McNelly recounted that he and Herbert had friendly correspondence over the phone and they were largely in agreement over the contents. They had one disagreement however.</p>
<p>This implies that Frank did not intend for Mohiam to be the mother of Jessica in his canonical works and only allowed it through due to the in-universe nature of the encyclopedia. This further muddies the waters as to the canonicity of Dune, as Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson claimed that Mohiam being the mother of Jessica, which they included in their books, was something they discovered in Herbert's notes.</p>
<h2>Influence</h2>
<p>The Dune Encyclopedia was also used as a sourcebook for the Dune computer games, developed by Westwood Studios. It was from the Encyclopedia that Westwood sourced the name "House Ordos," which first appeared in Dune II, although the crest used is actually that of House Wallach recolored. The Dune Encyclopedia displays Ordos's crest as being bones forming a letter "X" with ivy entwined around one corner, rather than a snake coiled around a book. Many official pieces of Dune media use full names given in the Dune Encyclopedia, such as Otto Aramsham and Stilgar ben Fifrawi. [6][7]</p>
