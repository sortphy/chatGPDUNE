    <h1>Order of Mentats</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Order of Mentats was the organization of the Mentats, the "human computers" of the Corrino Empire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Order was founded by Gilbertus Albans, the first Mentat, in the aftermath of the Butlerian Jihad. After doing so, he needed temporary sanctuary with Bene Tleilax who hoped to incorporate them into Tleilaxu hegemony. The Order then spread into uncounted "seed schools".</p>
<p>The Order remained until suppressed by the God Emperor Leto Atreides II because they formed a nucleus of independent opposition.</p>
